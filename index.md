<p>The Virus Spread is a simulation which aims to demonstrate the importance of social distancing during a global pandemic. There are colorful balls randomly floating on the screen. They represent people and different colors represent their different statuses: healthy, infected and recovered. When the simulation starts users can observe spread of the virus and tap on healthy balls to put them in a social distancing mode. This way users can see how application of social distancing affects the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>The simulation code was created on an iPad using Swift Playgrounds app. I considered different coding approaches and finally settled on SpriteKit since the simulation was similar to a game. This gave me the necessary structure and freedom to create the playground exactly as I wanted it to be. I separated the code into multiple functions and used them later in the main module. I used my knowledge of coding to create my playground and ultimately to illustrate my initial idea of the simulation. I knew this idea, displaying the spread of virus, would not only be fun and educational to create but also informative and educational to the public during these desperate times.</p>
